# AI Layer (Agentic Extensions)

This directory hosts agentic capabilities that work *alongside* the Selenium framework.

Goal: Make automated testing not only fast, but intelligently fast.

Agents will:
- analyze test failures
- suggest fixes
- map code changes to test scope
- recommend locator healing
- generate test data and scenarios

Current agents:
- failure-analyzer (in progress)
